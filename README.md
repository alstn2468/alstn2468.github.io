#### Ready to get started? Build your own site from scratch or generate one for your project.
#### You get one site per GitHub account and organization,
#### and unlimited project sites. Let‘s get started.
- - -
### 1. Create a repository
- - -
Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) named username.github.io,<br>
where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.<br>
If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.<br>
### 2. Clone the repository
- - -
Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
### 3. Hello World
- - -
Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:
```
cd username.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
```
### 4. Push it
- - -
Add, commit, and push your changes:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```
### 5. …and you're done!
- - -
Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.
